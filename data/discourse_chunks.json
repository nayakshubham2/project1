Deadline: Sunday, June 22, 2025 11:59 PM @carlton @Jivraj @HritikRoshan_HRM --- Subject: Issue with Scraping BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan JSON Forecast Question 4: Scraping BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan Weather Forecast I\u2019m trying to retrieve the JSON weather forecast description for Nur-Sultan using the BBC Weather API. However, I noticed that the BBC website lists the city as \u201cAstana\u201d instead of Nur-Sultan. When I attempt to use the JSON data for Astana, I encounter the following error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading \u2018id\u2019) How should I proceed to correctly scrape the weather forecast for Nur-Sultan? how can I resolve the TypeError issue? Any guidance on handling city name --- Hello, @Jivraj @carlton @HritikRoshan_HRM In GA4 Q2 it is mentioned that result changes as per location. I am getting this error: At [4].title: Values don't match. Expected: \"5. La Nuit des clowns\". Actual: \"5. Clown in a Cornfield\" But when checked manually, the result I got was correct as per the filters applied. The difference seems to be due to region-specific variations in IMDb search results. Can you please clarify what should be done in such cases? Should we proceed with the region-specific result, or is there a standard way to align the output with the expected values? --- For the 8th question, I keep getting the same error: \u2018Latest run does not include 24f2001830@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the name\u2019, even though my step name does contain my email id.

You can make this more productive by Elaborating your question sufficiently and supporting it with steps that you have already tried at your end before posting this question Sharing additional content or explanations related to the topic being discussed - Are there any rules for posting in this category? Before you create a new post, review the existing threads to see if there are already highly similar or identical postings. Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles Tag the post appropriately so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1 Provide a meaningful title to your post that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like \u201cAQ1.1 Q3\u201d which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - \u201cNeed help in calculating the \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc61 \u210e N th prime number\u201d Type in your question and explanations rather than pasting images or screenshots. - What is NOT Permitted in this category?

It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard. The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point. What\u2019s the context and the motivation? Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text. Can\u2019t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker.

The speaker didn\u2019t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren\u2019t\u2026In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem. Summary. I feel the course is offered too early. Rather, I took it a little too early. Definitely, I can\u2019t relate to most things the speaker is talking about. At least, I don\u2019t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program. I\u2019m sure it does, but now, I don\u2019t know how. Sorry, I\u2019d never been as critical about anything as this one. I just had to. I\u2019m willing to hear different opinions. I\u2019m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop. --- I am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don\u2019t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME. Hopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum. --- I feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses.

Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation. But I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only \u201ccomprehension\u201d type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay. --- As of now, I\u2019m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week. Will continue after all other ML courses are done\u2026 --- Some sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts. In the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share. --- Adding to the discussion here, I\u2019d also have to say it\u2019s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it\u2019s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions. --- Participants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary.

From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it. The other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience. --- I also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting. --- As my peers said i also feels the same way but i don\u2019t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey. --- well, my choice of dropping might be wrong\u2026but, guided by the following factors. The recording was perhaps done much earlier as @CKPIITM pointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would\u2019ve been already recorded. So, lesser chances to re-record them. There are no live sessions planned yet for this course\u2026 the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it\u2019s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation. Finally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up. --- Imagine if your reason doesn\u2019t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don\u2019t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material. @Anand --- CKPIITM: I know I can pass any course but I don\u2019t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. wasn\u2019t it you who wrote this earlier --- But this",

I always find ways to learn. I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge. --- I certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread. In my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question. --- I also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced. --- I too find content of week 1 engaging and practical.

Now, you will see a bunch of cookies, which are similar to a python dictionary containing key-value pairs. You only care about two such keys, one is _t and the other one is _forum_session. Save the value of these cookie keys in a python file like my_cookies.py: # my_cookies.py _t = \"your _t cookie\" _forum_session = \"your _forum_session cookie\" Now, these can be imported into other files using: from my_cookies import _t, _forum_session auth_cookie: dict = { '_t' : _t , '_forum_session': _forum_session } Note that these cookies keep changing, when you make new requests you get different values that replace the current values of your session. You can think of the session as a user. Now, look at my previous reply: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/help-required-in-project-1-scrapping-discourse-data/179153/2?u=23f1000917 The requests module is used to send requests to websites in python. You need to install it using pip install requests. You create a session object and add your cookies in it. This automatically handles the changing and replacement of cookie values when you make requests. Search for a tutorial on the requests module to understand how to make requests using it. Just know that you can do the something like this: import requests URL = \"https://example.com/latest_threads.json\" session = requests.Session() response = session.get(URL) if response.status_code=200: data = response.json() # get json data Lastly, watch the live sessions conducted by IITM on 10th June and next few days. You can find them in your google calendar. --- @23f1000917 thanks",

In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don\u2019t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.

I apologise that your score has not reflected on your dashboard. I was not given an updated enrollment list of students on the course, so although we have your submission scores it was not pushed to the dashboard because as far as I was aware you were not on TDS enrollment list that was provided to us by operations @jkmadathil . We will make the corrections and inform operations. It will take a few days to get sorted out. Thanks for letting us know and for your patience. Kind regards TDS Team",

I\u2019ve been trying to go a bit deeper into Module 1 after completing GA1, and I\u2019ve encountered some issues while experimenting with the llm CLI tool and different models. Specifically, I tried running the following command to test the Gemini model, as shown on the Module 3 introduction page: llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 But I received the following error: Error: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'No auth credentials found', 'code': 401}} Initially, I had set my OpenAI key from AIPipe , but I got a \u201cmodel not found\u201d error. So I checked the available models using: llm model list At that point, the Gemini model wasn\u2019t listed. I then installed the llm-openrouter plugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I\u2019m now facing the above authentication error. To test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn\u2019t need any credits to be purchased) llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free This worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine.

Week1TDS 2479\u00d7778 169 KB --- @22f3000680 My only comment here would be, in TDS we do not use html, css or js for creating what the user will see. For us the reason to know this is to help us extract data. We will not be creating any user frontends. For a developer, they will use these technologies to create front ends, validation etc. We leverage them for data extraction as data scientists. sqlite (or more broadly databases) again will be used purely from a data extraction perspective. We will not require you to learn how to create them or modify them. The goal in TDS is not to make you a developer, but rather to understand how to leverage technologies to source, extract, transform and deploy data in a useable form, which is very different from being a software developer. Granted there are significant overlaps when you learn these technologies and tools. Being good at TDS will inevitably mean you will be significantly well equipped to create end to end solutions. Learning html, css, javascript, sql will give you the capability to develop web sites etc, but we are never going to create one and so we will not spend time learning how to build one. Nice map!
