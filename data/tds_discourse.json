However, I noticed that the BBC website lists the city as \u201cAstana\u201d instead of Nur-Sultan. When I attempt to use the JSON data for Astana, I encounter the following error:\n\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading \u2018id\u2019)\n\nHow should I proceed to correctly scrape the weather forecast for Nur-Sultan? how can I resolve the TypeError issue? Any guidance on handling city name\n\n---\n\nHello,\n\n@Jivraj\n@carlton\n@HritikRoshan_HRM\n\nIn GA4 Q2 it is mentioned that result changes as per location. I am getting this error:\n\nAt [4].title: Values don't match. Expected: \"5. La Nuit des clowns\". Actual: \"5. Clown in a Cornfield\"\n\n\nBut when checked manually, the result I got was correct as per the filters applied. The difference seems to be due to region-specific variations in IMDb search results.\n\nCan you please clarify what should be done in such cases? Should we proceed with the region-specific result, or is there a standard way to align the output with the expected values?\n\n---\n\nFor the 8th question, I keep getting the same error: \u2018Latest run does not include 24f2001830@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the name\u2019, even though my step name does contain my email id.\nCode for workflow is as below:\n\nname: Daily commits by 24f2001830@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day\n    - cron: \"0 0 * * *\"\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers\n\njobs:\n  committing:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Commit as 24f2001830@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n        run: |\n          echo \"Daily update: $(date)\" >> daily_log.txt\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add daily_log.txt\n          git commit -m \"Daily commit: $(date)\" || echo \"No changes to commit\"\n          git push || echo \"Nothing to push\""

What is it for?\n\n\nThe larger goal of the Discourse forum is to act as a Knowledge base for the course. You can make this more productive by\n\nElaborating your question sufficiently and supporting it with steps that you have already tried at your end before posting this question\n\nSharing additional content or explanations related to the topic being discussed\n\n-  Are there any rules for posting in this category?\n\n\nBefore you create a new post, review the existing threads to see if there are already highly similar or identical postings. Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles\n\nTag the post appropriately so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1\n\nProvide a meaningful title to your post that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like \u201cAQ1.1 Q3\u201d which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - \u201cNeed help in calculating the \n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc61\n\u210e\nN\nth\n prime number\u201d\n\nType in your question and explanations rather than pasting images or screenshots.\n\n- What is NOT Permitted in this category?\n\n\nBeing argumentative or sarcastic\n\nUse of abusive/strong language\n\nPosting support/logistics related query\n\nUnnecessarily tagging Faculty/Instructors in posts\n\nPosting Solutions or discussing solutions to graded assignments\n\n- Who will be moderating the content in this forum?\n\n\nThe foum will be moderated by Course Instructors. They will have the authority to decide whether a post violates forum rules/guidelines. You can flag/report any such violations that you observe by clicking on  icon on the post. Please do mention the reason why you are flagging the topic.\n\n  - What are the disciplinary actions if some one violates the rules and guidelines of the forum? \n\n\nThe flagged posts that violates forum rules/guidelines will be hidden. Repeated violation of the rules can result in the offender being removal from the forum.\n\n---\n\nCan some course instructor talk more about the Discover the problem statement ?\n\n---\n\nFrom the graded assignment we can\u2019t understand what is right way to think unless we make trial and error. can we have some practice assignment to understand our thinking process is properly aligned or not. With just GA it would be difficult to assess.\n\n---\n\nApart from what @CKPIITM observed about this course, here\u2019s my first impression of this course\u2026Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway\u2026\n\nThe week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective. It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard. The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point. What\u2019s the context and the motivation? Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text. Can\u2019t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker. Neither does give me much understanding anyway. It was filled with terminology that I\u2019m yet to pick up. The speaker didn\u2019t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren\u2019t\u2026In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\n\nSummary. I feel the course is offered too early. Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can\u2019t relate to most things the speaker is talking about. At least, I don\u2019t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program. I\u2019m sure it does, but now, I don\u2019t know how.\n\nSorry, I\u2019d never been as critical about anything as this one. I just had to. I\u2019m willing to hear different opinions.\n\nI\u2019m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.\n\n---\n\nI am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don\u2019t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.\n\nHopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.\n\n---\n\nI feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don\u2019t know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.\n\nBut I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only \u201ccomprehension\u201d type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.\n\n---\n\nAs of now, I\u2019m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week. Will continue after all other ML courses are done\u2026\n\n---\n\nSome sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts.\nIn the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share.\n\n---\n\nAdding to the discussion here, I\u2019d also have to say it\u2019s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it\u2019s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.\n\n---\n\nParticipants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it.\n\nThe other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.\n\n---\n\nI also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.\n\n---\n\nAs my peers said i also feels the same way but i don\u2019t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.\n\n---\n\nwell, my choice of dropping might be wrong\u2026but, guided by the following factors.\n\nThe recording was perhaps done much earlier as @CKPIITM pointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would\u2019ve been already recorded. So, lesser chances to re-record them.\n\nThere are no live sessions planned yet for this course\u2026 the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it\u2019s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.\n\nFinally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.\n\n---\n\nImagine if your reason doesn\u2019t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don\u2019t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material.\n@Anand\n\n---\n\nCKPIITM:\n\nI know I can pass any course but I don\u2019t just wanna pass without any concrete learning.\n\nwasn\u2019t it you who wrote this earlier\n\n---\n\nBut this will not lead me to dropping either. I always find ways to learn.  I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge.\n\n---\n\nI certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread.\nIn my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question.\n\n---\n\nI also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced.\n\n---\n\nI too find content of week 1 engaging and practical. I agree with @anand095 and @akruti.\n\n---\n\nInteresting! Just this morning, during my morning walk I was thinking how each of us is different in our outlook, our potential, how we realize it, how we\u2019re challenged\u2026and the recent posts show that we indeed are different! It\u2019s important that none of us stay put on what works for us and what we think is right, but be willing to see the other point of view too\u2026\n\nI think I\u2019m starting to understand the other points of view\u2026well I\u2019m trying to"

I was testing my model but was getting the same response every time even though my model was giving the expected answer to those question when tested separately. I found that in the test file (promptfoo.yaml) the cache is marked as true and because of which whenever i try to run the test file it does not hit my api endpoint and take the old response from the cache. So i changed the cache to false and tried running that test file and got the results as shown below in the image.\n\nimage\n1861\u00d7912 105 KB\n\nIn this as you can see for the 2nd test case since i am using the openai model to give the final answer so it is using my context and saying that dashboard will show 11/10, but the expected answer should contain \u201c110\u201d. The problem i am facing is as you can see the url given in my response is same as expected which means my model is picking the right context to answer the question but since i am using openai to make my final answer using this context it is very unlikely that it will say that dashboard will show \u201c110\u201d because this doesn\u2019t make sense. So can you please help me how should i tackle this ? As this is the only test case left.\n\nAnd also i have added one prompt field in the test file because i was getting warning regarding this missing field again and again. So is it okay ?\n\n---\n\n@HritikRoshan_HRM sir can you please help me with this.\n\n---\n\nNot able to access the tds project link.\n\n\nTDS_Project1\n898\u00d7509 16.7 KB\n\n---\n\ntds.s-anand.net\nTools in Data Science\n\n---\n\nNot this one the GitHub repository URL and API endpoint URL submission link not opening.\nSir my all links are working like I submitted by GA1 also but only my project submission link not working.

I am also not able access submission link.\n\n---\n\nSir, the question\u2019s background specifies that we should use Discourse posts from January 1, 2025 through April 14, 2025. However, in first testcase we are asked to answer based on the following Discourse post\u2014which dates outside that window:\nhttps://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939\n\nIs this an error in the question\u2019s timeframe?\n\n---\n\nInteresting, that\u2019s my post from Sep 24 Term. I am curious about the context and why did an 8 month old post come up in a Test.\n\n---\n\nI guess, this question is also covered in previous term, i.e., t1-2025\n\n---\n\nActually, in this term (May 25), we received our first project as TDS Virtual TA, where we are tasked with designing a chatbot API that acts as a virtual TA. For this project, your post has been provided as an example test case.\n\n---\n\nSorry, but I couldn\u2019t find any related question. Could you please send me the link to the post, if you have it?\n\n---\n\nIt maybe in week-4 or 5 GA\n\n---\n\n@Jivraj @carlton Sir, any updates on my issue?\n\n---\n\nSir, i have build an initial model for my project and when i test some question separately then i get somewhat expected answer like\n\nimage\n1136\u00d7435 11.3 KB\n\nthis is the response which i got from my model\n\n@carlton sir can you please help me in this\n\n---\n\nAnd the in the test file given in the project description this is the response for this question\n\nimage\n965\u00d7296 9.81 KB\n\n---\n\nThis is the response of the same question given in the promtfoo.yaml file which we have to use for the testing purpose by editing our api endpoint.\n\nBut the issue is, when i test this file by running that promtfoo.yaml file by editing my api endpoin then for this same question the test case fails.\n\nimage\n1179\u00d7191 12.9 KB\n\nalso the answer which it shows is not what i get when i run my model for this question as shown in the above image.

Good luck!\n\n---\n\ndid u get an api key for discourse to scrape the data can u help me with that @23f1000917\n\n---\n\ni am currently running it in local host 8000 other functionalities are working this is the problem data scraping\n\n---\n\nOkay, I will explain it to you.\n\nUpon visiting discourse and signing in with your account, you get \u2018cookies\u2019 containing information that can be used to authorize you. These cookies are sent with each subsequent request you make to discourse, if the website does not recognize these cookies, they simply reject your request with a status code of 403.\n\nIf you want to scrape the posts, you need to get these cookies. So, where are these cookies stored? Well, just sign into discourse with your IITM account (in Chrome). Then, visit the following URL:\nhttps://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/session/current.json\n\nOnce the page has opened and you can see JSON data, do the following:\nright click > inspect > application > cookies > https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/.\n\nNow, you will see a bunch of cookies, which are similar to a python dictionary containing key-value pairs. You only care about two such keys, one is _t and the other one is _forum_session.\n\nSave the value of these cookie keys in a python file like my_cookies.py:\n\n# my_cookies.py \n_t = \"your _t cookie\"\n_forum_session = \"your _forum_session cookie\"\n\n\nNow, these can be imported into other files using:\nfrom my_cookies import _t, _forum_session\n\nauth_cookie: dict = { '_t' : _t , '_forum_session': _forum_session }\n\n\n\nNote that these cookies keep changing, when you make new requests you get different values that replace the current values of your session. You can think of the session as a user.\n\nNow, look at my previous reply:\nhttps://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/help-required-in-project-1-scrapping-discourse-data/179153/2?u=23f1000917\n\nThe requests module is used to send requests to websites in python. You need to install it using pip install requests. You create a session object and add your cookies in it. This automatically handles the changing and replacement of cookie values when you make requests.\n\nSearch for a tutorial on the requests module to understand how to make requests using it. Just know that you can do the something like this:\n\nimport requests \n\nURL = \"https://example.com/latest_threads.json\"\nsession = requests.Session()\nresponse = session.get(URL)\nif response.status_code=200:\n    data = response.json() # get json data \n\n\nLastly, watch the live sessions conducted by IITM on 10th June and next few days. You can find them in your google calendar.\n\n---\n\n@23f1000917 thanks bro will try this out"

After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good but, they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don\u2019t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.\n\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner.\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n23f1000917:\n\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow.

I apologise that your score has not reflected on your dashboard. I was not given an updated enrollment list of students on the course, so although we have your submission scores it was not pushed to the dashboard because as far as I was aware you were not on TDS enrollment list that was provided to us by operations @jkmadathil . We will make the corrections and inform operations. It will take a few days to get sorted out.\n\nThanks for letting us know and for your patience.\nKind regards\n\nTDS Team"

Check if any new folder was created in the process.\n\n---\n\nthis is very good reason to work in wsl instead of directly on your local machine. git bash I presume is a direct install on windows (a bash terminal for windows). bash is a very powerful tool and has to be used with care. unless you really know what you are doing, it is far better to work in isolated VMs like wsl or other similar setups or containers. It may be recoverable, but for future make sure you have regular backups of your work in the cloud like on OneDrive or Google Drive. Then recovery from fatal erasures is trivial.\n\nAs far as how to recover the files totally depends on what happened and if you have any recovery systems in place. It is hard to give generic advice without knowing your system. If there is Roll back or File History in your system it is quite possible to recover the files. Or if your work is all within OneDrive for example.\n\nKind regards\n\n---\n\nkritika0806:\n\ni even cant recall that what exactly code i wrote in git bash due to which this happened\n\nYou should take a look at your bash history. That might offer some clues as to what happened.\n\nhistory | tail should give you the last 10 commands you ran.\n\n---\n\nmany folders were created but none of them has my laptop data..\n\n---\n\ncommand not found\nit got erased\u2026\n\n---\n\nto the best of my abilities till now i am unable to backup it \u2026\nbut this taught me great things.\n\n---\n\nTry TestDisk.\n\nTestDisk is a tool for recovering files which have been deleted.\n\nInstall testdisk\nEnter testisk into the command line, and the utility will start.\nSelect your partition to search in.\nSelect quick search or deeper search.\ntestdisk will output which files have been recovered and then you can decide to recover or not.\n\n\nA tutorial on testdisk at the following link, How to Install TestDisk on Linux and Recover Deleted Files | DigitalOcean\n\nAlso available on Windows, don\u2019t know the steps though."

Token & codesapces timeout after a certain period and you need to redo those.\nEasiest way is to do till q8 one by one and anytime you like they are persistent, and for all the rest try to do them at a sitting and don\u2019t close any of the servers (local apis, codespace, ngrok) till all submit\n\n---\n\nSome submissions require live server, so you have to run that particular code everytime you are solving those questions."

Due to this, I am finding it difficult to allocate sufficient time and focus towards completing the project with the quality it deserves.\n\nI genuinely want to put in my best effort for this project and would be extremely grateful if the deadline could be extended by a few days to allow for proper completion.\n\n---\n\nYes date shoud be extended.\n\n---\n\nYes I support this..

I also genuinely feel the deadline should be extended, because of Paradox fest. I\u2019m a coordinator in the Culturals Team. We are dedicating more time in the fest than others, including reaching there earlier. Also, we have deadlines for other courses and projects as well. Please consider this and extend the deadline.\n\n@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand\n\n---\n\nYeah, because of the paradox, it is tough for me to submit the project on 14\n. I would reach home at 11 or maybe 12 if the train is late. So it would be tough for me to submit the project on 14. Please give us 3-4 day extension\n\n---\n\nYes, we need time because after GA3 submission we will be in paradox and will be back by 10 June and deadline is 14 June, 4 days are not sufficient. Kindly please extend the deadline.\n\n---\n\nYess Sir we need some time to properly learn and implement a project of this scale.

So I checked the available models using:\n\nllm model list\n\n\nAt that point, the Gemini model wasn\u2019t listed.\n\nI then installed the llm-openrouter plugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I\u2019m now facing the above authentication error.\n\nTo test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn\u2019t need any credits to be purchased)\n\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free\n\n\nThis worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine.\n\nI\u2019m confused about how to properly authenticate for other via AIPipe for OpenRouter using the llm CLI. I\u2019ve been trying different approaches for the last two days but haven\u2019t been able to resolve this.\nCertainly! Here\u2019s a grammatically correct and polished version of the message you want to add at the end:\n\nI also tried setting the API keys individually for OpenAI, OpenRouter(this is basically configured while installing the plugin llm-openrouter), and even my personal keys, using the key management options mentioned in the llm documentation. Additionally, I saw that our course page suggest changing the base URL like this:\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\n\nHowever, even this approach didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nCould you kindly guide me on how to resolve this issue?\n\nThank you for your time and help.\n\nSincerely,\nMeikanda Sivam"

For us the reason to know this is to help us extract data. We will not be creating any user frontends. For a developer, they will use these technologies to create front ends, validation etc. We leverage them for data extraction as data scientists.\n\nsqlite (or more broadly databases) again will be used purely from a data extraction perspective. We will not require you to learn how to create them or modify them.\n\nThe goal in TDS is not to make you a developer, but rather to understand how to leverage technologies to source, extract, transform and deploy data in a useable form,\nwhich is very different from being a software developer. Granted there are significant overlaps when you learn these technologies and tools. Being good at TDS will inevitably mean you will be significantly well equipped to create end to end solutions.\n\nLearning html, css, javascript, sql will give you the capability to develop web sites etc, but we are never going to create one and so we will not spend time learning how to build one.\n\nNice map!\nKind regards"
